Device configuration for the acer iconia a500 (picasso)

NOTE: both extract-files.sh and local-extract-files.sh are broken and will destroy your vendor/acer folder. I am currently to lazy to finish them. Ill work on it once I feel the vendor tree is more stable. currently I am changing to many things around to make changes to all of the scripts. 

to compile cm version go to /vendor/cm/vendorsetup.sh
and add "add_lunch_combo cm_picasso-userdebug"

compile and have fun!

Always Open.
